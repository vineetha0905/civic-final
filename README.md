# CivicConnect – Implementation Flow (Non-Technical)

This section explains, in simple terms, how the whole system works for citizens and admins.

## How a citizen uses the app

1. Open the app and choose Login or Register.
2. If new, go to Register, enter your Name, 12‑digit Aadhaar, 10‑digit Mobile, and Address.
   - You can tap “Use my location” to automatically fill your address from your current location.
3. After registering, you can log in using your Aadhaar number and a one‑time password (OTP) sent to you.
4. Once logged in, you can report issues, view your reports, and track updates.

## How login with Aadhaar + OTP works

1. You enter your 12‑digit Aadhaar number and tap Send OTP.
2. The system sends a 6‑digit OTP and starts a short timer.
3. You enter the OTP and tap Verify; if it matches and is on time, you’re signed in.

## What happens behind the scenes (simple view)

1. When you register: your details are saved safely; if your number was seen before, your account is updated instead of blocked.
2. When you request an OTP: if you don’t have an account yet, the app creates a basic account for you so you can finish later.
3. When you verify the OTP: the app confirms it’s correct and lets you in.

## Admin experience

1. Admins sign in to view reports, prioritize them, assign work, and track resolution.
2. Admins can see activity and get notified about new updates.

## Key benefits

- Easy sign‑in with Aadhaar + OTP (no passwords to remember).
- Quick registration with automatic address fill from your location.
- Clear status tracking for reported issues.
